Beacons and Tracking Pixels

    When to use:
        Need to post data to another domain with no need for reply or acknowledgement (a.k.a. logging)  

    An image reference does not have a limitations on domain access and does not use XHR, just like any DOM element with a src attribute

    The source doesn't have to be an actual image 

    Can be a service that does logging 

    Should return a transparent 1px by 1px gif so some browsers don't show a broken link

    Can just read web server logs to get values instead of manually logging

============================================================================
Server-Side Proxy

    When to use:
        Need to access a resource on another domain using XHR where you need to process the response
        You want to sanitize or format the results before they are sent to the client 

    Since XHR and JS can't call cross-domain, create a resource (service, page, etc.) on your site that makes the call server-side and does not have this limitation

    Creates a server-side dependency to manage, version, and update along with either your web site or with the changing service

    Extra network hop

    Translating from client->server->client creates an impedance mismatch at times

    It's simply plumbing, so it's wasted work when there are more appropriate implementations available

============================================================================
Dynamic Script Injection and JSONP (JSON with Padding)

    When to use:
        Don't have access to server-side of host
        Don't want to have clients/users have to build a proxy
        Want to encourage mash-ups and ease-of-use 
         You TRUST the service provider

    Script tags are designed to be included cross-domain, just like any other DOM element with a src attribute

    Using server-side code, dynamically generate the JavaScript that gets loaded as the "static" script source 

    Allow callers to specify arguments, including a callback

    Heavily used by Yahoo!, Google, and many others

    jQuery supports natively with $.getJSON('...&callback=?');

============================================================================
Using iframes to Display Content

     When to use:
        Federate your content/services across the web without requiring a server-to-server implementation
        Desire light lift and easily usable by HTML n00b's, designers, and advanced developers!
        Let's you as the service provider fully see the user (cookies, headers, etc.) and interact
                                                            
    Typically well-defined size of iframe in px
    Can provide arguments to blend in seamlessly (colors, borders, JS resize)
    Reputation: "Old School", "unsophisticated"
 
Let's digress for a bit into the mythical land of iframes...                                                                            

============================================================================
Domain Lowering

    When to use:
        You have a site on a domain (or sub-domain) and you have a service on a sub-domain of that root domain that you want to scale separately from the web site
        Want to maintain the security that XHR provides
        As a fallback for older browsers without window.postMessage() support

    JavaScript can call JavaScript functions defined in iframes that have the same document.domain
    Browsers allow you to redefine document.domain, as long as it's a "lowered domain" (e.g., services.domain.com -> domain.com)
    This lowering does NOT impact XHR objects, so you can still make XHR requests to services.domain.com, but the host site on domain.com can call the JavaScript that makes the XHR call!    EXCEPT OPERA!!

============================================================================
window.postMessage()
HTML5: window.postMessage 
(and new iframe attributes: sandbox, seamless)

    When to use: 
        Lightweight JavaScript interaction with hidden or visible iframes
        Want to scale services separately from site but want XHR-type capability and security
        You support mostly modern browsers

    Only pass a string message with targetOrigin (* for all)

    Receiver window/frame has an event listener for the 'message' event
    Event has several properties: data, source, origin
    Asynchronous messaging model
        no return value
        send response messages back to the event.source
    Beware browser differences (but they are narrowing)

============================================================================
Cross-Domain JavaScript Cheat Sheet

    Beacons/Tracking Pixels 
        Send data cross-domain, one-way

    Server-side proxy 
        Need XHR to call and process response
        Want to sanitize/format before sending to client 

    JSONP
        Trusted service
        Can process raw response in JavaScript
        You are using jQuery 

    iframe Display of Content
        Control UI / Support "embeddable" widgets
        Interactivity with end user
        Usually fixed size

    iframe Location Communication
        Minimal data passed one-way
        May need an XD page on your site for the iframe to open an iframe for response passing
 
    Domain Lowering
        Only use as fallback for older browsers window.postMessage is not available AND
        Services on domain/sub-domain that you control AND
        Want to scale services separately from site but want XHR capability 

    window.postMessage
        Lightweight JavaScript interaction with hidden or visible iframes
        Want to scale services separately from site but want XHR capability
        Support modern browsers 
        Will need fallback of Domain Lowering,  if you own domain, or iframe Location Communication XD page if you don't
